# Module 5 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler

This repo is for module five's challenge assignment.

## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The starter code uses the Day.jsLinks to an external site. library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality.

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to utilize all previous skills we have been learning and new ones such as Web APIs, Third-Party APIs and Server-Side APIs. I built this project in order to hone all the coding skills thus far. The problem it solved is creating a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day. After completing this project, I have learned a plethora in all the previous coursework, in particular, JavaScript and APIs.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Usage

- Go to the Calendar web application
- The top of the webpage displays the Work Day Scheduler title, a short description, the day of the week and date (i.e. Monday, July 10th, 2023)
- Click on each hour in order to input events and click the save button to save events for your typical work day (9am-5pm)
- Events in GREY already happened, events in RED are happening currently and events in GREEN are new events to occur later that day
- When the events are saved, they are saved on the user's local storage (whatever local device they are using)
